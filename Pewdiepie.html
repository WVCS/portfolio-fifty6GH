<p style="font-size:50px;"><b>Who is Ninja?</b><pre>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Richard Tyler Blevins, who is commonly known as "Ninja," is a popular streamer on the website called Twitch. He is known for being extremely 
skilled at the massively popular online game Fortnite. Ninja has a following of over 13 million followers and gets over 20,000 viewers every week.
He constantly streams everyday for multiple hours at a time, and as a result earns almost 500,000 dollars every month. He makes these profits from 
his viewers who can subscribe to him for a monthly fee, as well as viewers who donate money to him live during his streams to support him further.
People can also simply "follow" a streamer to be notified when their streamer is online without paying a monthly fee.
<h3><h3 style="font-size:50px;"><b>What is Twitch?</b></h3>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Twitch is a live streaming video platform owned by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of Amazon. Launched in 2011, Twitch 
has amassed over 15 million users and over 2.2 million streamers. Users on Twitch can watch streamers play their favorite games live, and can interact
with the streamer and other viewers using Twitch's built-in chat. Viewers donate money to ensure that their streamers can continue to afford to stream,
and when you look at someone like Ninja, it's clear that the donations really do make a difference.
</p><h4><h4 style="font-size:50px;"><b>How Did Ninja Get So Popular?</b></h4> <p> <p style="font-size:20px;">
Richard Tyler Blevins was originally a professional Halo Player. He played competitively for many eSports leagues including Cloud9 and Team Liquid, 
which are some of the best eSports teams around. He slowly switched over to playing the battle royale game called H1Z1. This was a long time ago, and
there have recently been clips on Ninja that arose showing him being insulting, rude, and mean to other players in-game. These clips involve him
raging as well as running, screaming, and cussing. However, after H1Z1 he switched to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, another battle royale game that
really kicked off the battle royale genre on Twitch, as it was one of the most enjoyable kinds of games to spectate. After a while, Ninja had 
discovered Fortnite. He slowly started getting better and better in the early days of beta Fortnite, and was becoming a well known name in the Fortnite
community as the game grew massively in popularity. People tuned in to watch Ninja for his incredible kills and entertaining methods of killing
clueless and beginner players. He started to gain subscribers at an exponential rate, and it's clear why.</p> </pre>
